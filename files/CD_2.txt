AIM- Write a C program to identify whether a given line is a comment or not.

RESOURCE-
Turbo C++ 

PROGRAM LOGIC- 
Read the input string. 
Check whether the string is starting with ‘/’ and check next character is ‘/’ or’*’. 
If condition satisfies print comment. 
Else not a comment. 

PROCEDURE- 
Go to debug -> run or press CTRL + F9 to run the program.

THEORY-
In the C programming language, comments are non-executable parts of the source code used to explain the logic, 
make notes for the programmer, or temporarily disable parts of the code during debugging. There are two types of
comments in C: single-line comments and multi-line comments. Single-line comments start with a double forward slash (//) 
and continue until the end of the line. Multi-line comments begin with a /* and end with a */, allowing them to span several 
lines. Identifying whether a given line is a comment is useful for building basic compilers, code analyzers, or formatting tools. 
In a simple C program to detect comments, the input line is first checked for the presence of a / as the first character. If found, 
the second character determines the type: if it is another /, it is a single-line comment; if it is an asterisk *, it indicates the 
start of a multi-line comment. Any other character sequence following a / is not treated as a comment. This simple detection does not 
handle full multi-line comment blocks or edge cases but serves as a basic demonstration of string analysis and pattern recognition in C programming. 
Such programs help new programmers understand input parsing and condition checking.

CODE-
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char line[1000];

    printf("Enter a line of code: ");
    fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdin);

    if (line[0] == '/') {
        if (line[1] == '/') {
            printf("It is a single-line comment.\n");
        } else if (line[1] == '*') {
            printf("It is the start of a multi-line comment.\n");
        } else {
            printf("It is not a comment.\n");
        }
    } else {
        printf("It is not a comment.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
